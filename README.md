## About

This repository is where the IOTA Foundation hosts the open-source code for the [Tangle Utilities website](https://utils.iota.org/).

![Tangle Utilities](images/tangle-utilities.png)

The code is composed of the following packages:

- [**`api`:**](api/README.md) Handles functionality such as currency conversion for the client
- [**`client`:**](client/README.md) Provides a user interface for the utilities, using React.

A demonstration of the API is available [here](https://utils-api.iota.org).

This is beta software, so there may be performance and stability issues.
Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/tangle-utils-website/issues/new).

## Prerequisites

To deploy your own version of the Tangle Utilities website, you need to have at least [version 10 of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your device.

To check if you have Node.js installed, run the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is installed, you should see the version that's installed.
